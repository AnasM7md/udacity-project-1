In this project I chose dataset from Airbnb website which is 'listings'.
I used the following libraries to assist me achieving the requirement: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, LinearRegression, train_test_split, r2_score, and mean_squared_error.
the dataset uploaded so feel free to catch it.
the dateset about apartments/hotels price, longtitude, about its availability, and more..

why this project?
I chose this project due to the real need of choosing the best housing in traveling with optimal price and I faced that before, I enforced to pay more, for that I did an analysis of the dataset by Airbnb called Listings.
